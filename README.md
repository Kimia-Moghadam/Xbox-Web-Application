This is my first web development project where I built a website similar to the official Xbox platform. The website is fully responsive and built using modern technologies such as React, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and others. The layout, design, and functionality have been closely replicated from the original Xbox site to offer users a seamless experience.

Technologies Used:

React.js for the frontend

Tailwind CSS for custom, utility-first styling

Bootstrap for responsive grid system

JavaScript for interactive components

React Router for navigation

Features:

Fully responsive design

Dynamic routing using React Router

Clean and modern user interface
